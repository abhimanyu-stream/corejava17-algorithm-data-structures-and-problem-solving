package com.stream.Knapsack;

import java.util.Arrays;
//Example:
//Given weights and values of n items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack. In other words, given two integer arrays val[0..n-1] and wt[0..n-1] which represent values and weights associated with n items respectively. Also given an integer W which represents knapsack capacity, find out the maximum value subset of val[] such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to W. You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item, or don‚Äôt pick it (0-1 property).

/**
 * Below is a recursive implementation of the 0/1 Knapsack problem in Java 8.
 *
 * Problem Statement
 * You are given:
 *
 * A set of items, each with a weight and a value.
 * A knapsack with a maximum weight capacity.
 * The goal is to maximize the total value of items in the knapsack without exceeding its weight capacity.
 *
 * Explanation
 * Base Case:
 *
 * If there are no items left (n == 0) or the capacity is zero, the result is 0.
 * Recursive Case:
 *
 * If the weight of the current item exceeds the capacity, skip it.
 * Otherwise:
 * Calculate the value when including the current item.
 * Calculate the value when excluding the current item.
 * Return the maximum of these two options.
 * Parameters:
 *
 * capacity: Remaining capacity of the knapsack.
 * weights: Array of weights for the items.
 * values: Array of values for the items.
 * n: Number of items left to consider.
 * Output for the Example Input
 * yaml
 * Copy code
 * Maximum value in Knapsack: 220
 * Complexity
 * Time Complexity:
 * ùëÇ
 * (
 * 2
 * ùëõ
 * )
 * O(2
 * n
 *  ), due to two recursive calls for each item.
 * Space Complexity:
 * ùëÇ
 * (
 * ùëõ
 * )
 * O(n), for the recursion stack.
 * Notes
 * This implementation works well for small inputs but is inefficient for large problem sizes. To optimize it, consider implementing memoization or dynamic programming. Let me know if you‚Äôd like a more efficient version!
